Hi, My name is Janella Marie Masongsong

I completed my senior high school education at Santa Rosa Science High School. Presently, I am in my fourth year pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I recently wrapped up my internship with Ionics EMS Inc. My whole experience was really nice since I got to learn more about the field that I like which is web development.

I have a few hobbies that I enjoy, such as engaging in volleyball and playing mobile games. Additionally, I have a fondness for OPM music, and I'm a fan of artists like Twice, Enhypen, and Taylor Swift. I'm eagerly anticipating the chance to see my favorite KPOP group, Twice, when they perform on September 30th. In terms of movies, while I used to be a big fan of Marvel movies, I haven't been watching many lately, but I'm planning to change that. These days, I tend to watch more series like "Friends" and "How I Met Your Mother," and I'm also a big fan of KDramas!
